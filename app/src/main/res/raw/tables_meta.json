There is an inner keep where most inhabitants will shelter during a siege. The outer defenses are manned by defenders (archers and guards mostly). The castle likely has a handful of knights on hand to run down besieging infantry. Commonly, most of the rooms of the castle are part of the inner keep, but other layouts are not uncommon. The size of a castle can vary widely, as suggested by the number of defenders and the number of people it can protect. These numbers aren't superbly accurate in terms of medieval history, but they span the range I've found for small castles and large citadel-type castles (someone will correct me if I'm way off). I wouldn't expect that the castle could accommodate that many residents at all time. Only that with sufficient provisions, they could keep that many people (mostly frightened and defenseless commoners) safe from raiders or a foragers of an enemy army.
